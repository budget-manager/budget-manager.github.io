# Ground rules 

## Meeting Times:

> Routine is key

* 15 Minutes at the end of class everyday
* once a week for a longer time (weekend?)

## Communication

> The most important facet of our team work

* via Zoom meetings every day 
* via Slack #java-10-budget-manager  
* technical information through our Github repository.
* emergency details through phone
    * Mercedes  (832) 266 3422
    * Jeremy    (505) 331 1260
    * Jan       (505) 610 8538
* taking notes, document the problem and the solution
    
## Handling different situations

> Hard Times, fun times

* there is no room for egos
* there is no time to take things personal
* be open to the whole team
* when things are getting tense, walk back for it to calm down
* don't let grudges hang - speak up

* value the work of the other team members
* ask for help and offer help
* communicate
* don't be afraid to speak up but do it respectful
* celebrate the milestones

## Conflict resolution protocol

> The power of speaking up while keeping the volume low
>
>during conflicts,all team members need to remind themselves about the points made above
>in "Handling different situations".  
>In case a team member has a problem with how the team functions,
>he or she has the duty to speak up and needs to be heard and understood
>by the other team members.  
>If the team is not able to resolve the conflict internally, outside 
> assistance needs to be requested. This will depend on the nature 
>of the conflict.
>    * technical issues: Nick, Todd, Rishita
>    * issues with collaboration: Sue, Estaban
  

## Roles for every team member

>Know your strengths and your weaknesses

>To be discussed once the technical side of 
>the project materializes.
>One idea would be to make a list of our own strengths and 
>weaknesses and then assign tasks towards our talents.
>for example:
>    * Mercedes: creative, eye for detail
>    * Jeremy: thinks out of the box, fast decision maker
>    * Jan: organized, good with writing
>
>We can grade all the tasks with the skills that are needed and
>then assign them to the best matching team member.
>It is important though that not all tasks from the same scope of work
>per definition end up with the same person.

## Closing protocol for tasks

> Two pairs of eyes; work agreed by all

>it is necessary that important tasks are reviewed and agreed upon
>before being closed.  
If possible, every task needs to be reviewed by at least one other
>team member and communication is in place so that all team members
>can voice their agreement or veto before the task is pushed to GitHub.  
>One person of the team will be in charge of committing and pushing to
>GitHub. This can only happen after review by and agreement from other
>team members.
