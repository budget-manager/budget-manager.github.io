## Project description


>Budget manager is an Android app that helps individuals manage and track their spending on a daily 
or monthly basis. 
Users will assign their expenditures in different categories for monthly bills and expenses such as
gas, groceries, dining out, miscellaneous, personal spending, savings, and any other categories of 
their choosing for any duration of time. 
Personal savings goals can also be created to establish better spending habits.
The user will enter all transactions on a daily basis. 
The due dates and any extra notes can be created for each bill for organizational purposes. 
Budgets can be made for monthly recurring categories. 

>To access the app the user must log in to his Google account and will be directed to the home 
screen. This screen will display buttons directing you to three different fields: 
  * budgets
  * transactions
  * saving goals
>In _budget_ the user will see a dropdown menu with the predefined categories, and an option to
create his own budget. 
If _transactions_ is selected the user will be prompted to enter either positive or negative 
transactions to record their spending habits.
When accessing _saving goals_ the user will have a detailed overview of his current progress.
